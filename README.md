## AQuA-HiChIP uncovers global changes in protein-mediated contact frequency

Induced chromatin interactions anchored with protein contacts will be readily differentiated using AQuA-HiChIP, but with normalizing by total interactive paired-end tags (PETs), differential interaction frequencies may produce false positives or false negatives. 




## Comparison of HiChIP and AQuA-HiChIP between treated and untreated cells reveals the difference between apparent and absolute contact changes

Direct comparison of AQuA-HiChIP and non-reference normalized samples indicates apparent chromatin interaction changes anchored in H3-acetylation marks after rapid HDAC inhibition. These changes in architecture are focused near super enhancers (SEs) proximal to a TSS on chr11.
